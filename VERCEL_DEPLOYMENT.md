## Changes Made

✅ **Fixed corrupted .env file** - DATABASE_URL now properly formatted
✅ **Updated Prisma schema** - Added rhel-openssl-1.0.x binary target for Vercel compatibility
✅ **Added postinstall script** - Ensures Prisma client is generated during deployment
✅ **Created vercel.json** - Optimized for Vercel runtime environment
✅ **Updated Prisma client configuration** - Better connection handling and logging
✅ **Generated new Prisma client** - With updated binary targets

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit all changes to your Git repository:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - Update Prisma configuration and binary targets"
   git push
   ```

2. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Navigate to "Environment Variables"
   - Add all the environment variables listed above
   - Redeploy your application

3. **Or deploy using Vercel CLI:**

   ```

## What This Fixes

- **Prisma Query Engine Error**: Added correct binary targets for Vercel's runtime
